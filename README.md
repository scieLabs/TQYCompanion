# The Quiet Year Companion

[The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year) is a map game. You define the struggles of a community living after the collapse of civilization, and attempt to build something good within their quiet year. Every decision and every action is set against a backdrop of dwindling time and rising concern.

The game is played using a set of 52 prompts – each corresponds to a week during the quiet year. Each prompt triggers certain events – bringing bad news, good omens, project delays and sudden changes in luck. At the end of the quiet year, the Frost Shepherds will come, ending the game.

The Quiet Year occupies an interesting space – part roleplaying game, part cartographic poetry.

There is currently no way to play the game in a digital form without keeping track of a variety of different software: prompt randomizers, text documents, counters. This application aims to mitigate this issue by bringing most of the game's features (sans map!) to one place.
